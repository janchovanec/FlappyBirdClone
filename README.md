# Flappy Bird Clone
A simple Flappy Bird-style game built for Android as a school project. It’s pretty much what you’d expect: tap the screen to keep your bird airborne, dodge pipes, rack up points, and beat your own high scores. 
There’s also a settings menu to change volume and vibration, plus a skin system where you can pick from a few designs or snap a photo for a custom avatar.

## Highlights:
**Classic Gameplay:** Tap to flap, avoid pipes, and try not to crash.


**High Scores:** Always know your best run.


**Custom Skins:** Choose from a few pre-made bird skins or take a photo to create custom avatar.


**Settings:** Adjust volume and toggle vibration.

## Assets & Credits:
**Visuals:** Images generated by DALL·E and edited by me.


**Music:** Composed using Stable Audio.


**Sound Effects:** Handcrafted by me.

## Setup:
- Clone the repo and open in Android Studio.
- Run on your device or emulator.
- Tap away and have fun.
